How exciting!</p>\n<p>I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.</p>\n<p>Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg\">salted duck eggs</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck\neggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"Friday, May 1st 2015, 10:12:03 pm","title":"Hello Vue test","tags":["HOT","Chicago","choice"],"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/vue/hello-vue-test/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/photo/2019-03-03-logo-toweave/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Toweave's logo.","tags":["HOT","精选"]}}}}
